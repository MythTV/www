 <li>Thanks to Jeremy Oddo, who did all the hard work.  Little more, ah, advanced than the old page =)
 <li>You'll also notice the new 'Themes' section in the menu to the left -- everything there pretty much requires current CVS to run, but it's nice to finally have a nice way to organize theme contributions in one place.
