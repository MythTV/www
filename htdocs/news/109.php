  <li>The 0.16 release is now on the website.  A fairly comprehensive list of changes is <a href="http://www.mythtv.info/moin.cgi/WhatsNew">here</a>.
  <li>Should be fairly solid, but there're a few known issues that may end up causing trouble..  If enough people run in to them, I'll do a quick 0.16.1 release, but at this point, I don't think that'll be necessary.  I hope not, at least.
  <li>Oh - if anyone doesn't like the new menu items layout, just switch back to the old layout. (Utils/Setup -> Setup -> Appearance, Menu Theme.  Set it to 'classic').
  <li>Just wanted to point out that there's also a new module/plugin - MythPhone.  You can find more information about it <a href="http://www.zen13655.zen.co.uk/mythphone.html">here</a>.  It should be considered beta quality - it just went in to CVS a short time ago.
  <li>Standard release info:
  <ul>
    <li>Grab the release from the  <a href="/download">download section</a> and please at least try to read the <a href="/docs">docs</a> before asking questions. 
    <li>The <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Packages">binary packages</a> should hopefully be updated to 0.16 soon.
    <li>See this <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/modules.php?name=Web_Links&l_op=viewlink&cid=3">links section</a> for a list of complete linux distributions based around MythTV.
