<li>And so, without further babbling, <a href="#download">release 0.4</a>.  I decided that it was getting good enough to drop the 'preview' part of the release number.  Major new features: Music support, including the ability to rip, categorize, and play music, all in a nice interface meant for a remote control.  Support for themed menus.  Bugfixes.  Other stuff I forgot.  The music support is a separate download, called MythMusic.  It has additional software requirements, so I figured I wouldn't "contaminate" the main MythTV setup with them.  MythTV will integrate MythMusic into its menus when finds MythMusic installed on a system.

Looks nice, and thanks to <a href="http://www.forrestwalter.com">Forrest Walter</a> for his 'TangoBlue' theme (the first and third shots), and jer warren for his as yet unnamed theme (second shot).
<li>No updates in awhile, so I figured I do a big update all at once.
