  <li>So, I've been really busy with work recently, and haven't had as much time to work on all this as I'dve liked.  However, things are starting to shape up for the 0.8 release, and hopefully I'll have everything done to my satisfaction sometime this month.                                                              <li>New theme: <a href="http://www.ziarek.com/mythtv/themes.iulius.asp">Iulius</a>, by Nathan Ziarek.  Needs pretty current CVS to work.
  <li>Another new theme: <a href="http://tarek.2y.net/myth/SasQuatch.tar.gz">SasQuatch</a> (pictures <a href="http://tarek.2y.net/myth/tvmenu-1.png">here</a>, <a href="http://tarek.2y.net/myth/tvmenu-2.png">here</a>, and <a href="http://tarek.2y.net/myth/tvmenu-3.png">here</a>), by tarek Lubani.  Also requires pretty current CVS to work.                                                               <li>No other new eye candy, sorry.
</ul>
