  <li>I committed all the MythMusic code to CVS, so if anyone's interested in checking it out, go see the CVS info in the Downloads section.
  <li>Finished off the FLAC encoder for MythMusic..  Messy, messy API.  I really hope there aren't any bugs in my FLAC encoder/decoder code, since I've had enough 50 character function names to last for a good long while.  Anyway, the music stuff's all fairly seamless now, the user never has to know where files are, what they're called, what format they are, or anything.
