<ul>                                                                              <li>Started working on the Info screen for the program guide.  Pretty basic so far.  I'm thinking on adding the 'Record this show' 'Record this show once weekly' 'Record this show everytime it's played' interface to this screen.  Should work, I think.                                                                     <li>Fixed a couple small bugs:  Hitting the 'i' key in the tv app brought up the last OSD text, instead of the current info; The program guide would crash if there wasn't any info in the database.                                          
</ul>
