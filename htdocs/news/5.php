  <li>Started working on a program guide last night.  Check <a href="mc/early-epg.png">this screenshot</a> of what it looks like so far.  It's just a quick app written in QT.  First time I've used QT, really.  It's rather nice, at least compared to GTK.  Excellent documentation, a pretty thorough tutorial.  Anyway, all it does it display a time block of programming, and let you scroll around with the arrow keys for now.  More features, colors that better show up on a TV, and integration with the TV app are forthcoming.  It's in the CVS tree, in the epg/ directory, but as usual, there aren't any instructions at all.
