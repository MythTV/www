A quick overview of what's new:  Better, more robust A/V sync, courtesy of John Coiner.  Support for scheduled recordings, and playback and deletion of them, too.  NOTE: no recording time conflict resolution code has been written yet.  That's what I'm going to be working on next, but I wanted to get this release out the door first.  Remember, READ THE README.                                                                   <li>Updated the TODO list here on this page.                                  </ul>
