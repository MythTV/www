  <li>As promised, a screenshot of <a href="http://mythtv.sourceforge.net/mc/mythgamessbrowse.jpg">MythGame</a>.  It currently acts as a frontend to MAME, support for other emulators will be coming later.  It's _fast_ too -- startup is extremely quick, once its got all the information in the database.  Pretty spiffy. This'll be included in the upcoming 0.7 release.
