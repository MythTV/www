<li>Want to help?  I'd really like to pretty up some of the interfaces, but I can't draw worth beans..  Icons, a nice background, maybe a logo, all would be _great_.  My email's at the bottom of the page, please let me know if you're interested in contributing.
  <li>DSL.... saturated... . .. should've...  made.. . . smaller ....  ... screenshots..
  <li>Allright, preview release 3's <a href="#download">available here</a>.  Featuring manual and automatic scheduling conflict resolution, an easier build process, a spiffy little per-recording screenshot in the dialogs, and minor bugfixes all 'round.  If you're upgrading from an earlier release, read the README.  If you're installing it new, read the README.  Simple, really =)
  <li>Updated all the screenshots to show off the current release.  See how ugly the <a href="mc/mainmenu.png">main menu</a> is?  Wouldn't it be nice with a nice background and some spiffy icons?  Wouldn't you like to draw some?  =)
  <li>Added a red letter indicator to the program guide grid to show a scheduled recording -- a 'R' for a single recording, 'T' for a timeslot recording, and and 'A' for a record-anytime recording.  You can see a screenshot of this <a href="mc/epg.png">here</a>.
  <li>I think I'm going to put out another release later tonight..  we'll see.
</ul>
