  <li>Sorry, but there won't be a release tonight.  I announce a release, and patches just start flying out of the woodwork.  A lot of stuff went in to the CVS tree in the past couple weeks, and just to be safe, I'd like to get everything tested for a few more days.  Besides, it's late and I'm lazy. =)  Assuming that nothing major is broken, the release should happen on Wednesday or Thursday night.
  <li>Anyway, here's the <a href="http://www.mythtv.info/moin.cgi/UnderDevelopment">current changelog</a>, if you're interested in seeing what's going to be new / fixed in 0.17.
