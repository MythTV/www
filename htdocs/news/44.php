<li>Get <a href="#download">version 0.6 here</a>.  See the previous update for a changelog.  No mythweb or mythgame release right now, sorry, but maybe in a little bit.  Oh, and please forgive my slow DSL connection..                       <li>Feel free to visit #mythtv on irc.openprojects.net.  I'm not going to do much in the way of tech support, but anything else is cool..
