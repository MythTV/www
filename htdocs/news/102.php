  <li><b>Update:</b> I'm almost employed now (starting next week), so please, stop calling me with crazy schemes to sell MythTV boxes.
  <li>So, ah, not really MythTV related, but...
  <ul>
    <li>The good news is that I have a lot more free time for MythTV development, but it's still going to be a little while longer before 0.15 is ready -- I want to get a rewrite of the music selection interface done for the release, and I haven't really started on it yet.
    <li>The reason that I have this excess of free time is because as of last week, I'm unemployed.  So, that's fairly bad news, yeah?  Ah well.
  </ul>
   <li>Anyway, I figure that it can't hurt to throw my resume up on here, since my little pet project has turned into quite a monster over the past couple of years.  So, if anyone out there's looking to hire a software guy, here's my resume (removed).
  <li>Some more information:  I've telecommuted out of my house for the past 4 years, so that would be my preferred type of employment.  I'm not sure what the likelihood of something like that turning up is nowadays, so I've pretty much resigned myself to a daily commute longer than walking across a hall.  I'm not really wanting to relocate from the Cleveland, Ohio area, but I'd have to consider it for the right offer.
  <li>Thanks for reading this. =)
