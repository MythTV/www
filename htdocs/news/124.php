As you may or may not be aware, Zap2It is
<a href="http://labs.zap2it.com">going to stop offering TV listings to
US/Canadian users as of September 1st</a>.  But, fear not!  We've been busy
working on a solution for you.  While it's still just a little bit too early to
post details, we do have an
<a href="http://www.schedulesdirect.org">announcement page</a> posted with some
info.  We're specifically in need of a lawyer and accountant to help with some
initial setup.  So, keep watching
<a href="http://www.schedulesdirect.org">this space</a> - we're hoping for a
painless transition come September.
