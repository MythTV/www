<li>Been awhile since my last update, here's what's new:  The PIP code was mostly finished and added to CVS.  Richard Jones contributed code to support video filters to do stuff to the raw video frames, both pre-encoding, and post-decoding.  Existing filters from transcode can be ported with a minimum of effort.  I'm currently working on a replacement for the 'filldata' perl script.  Otherwise, I've just been working and playing Mario Sunshine.
