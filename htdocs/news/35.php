<li>And some more work in progress code: <a href="http://mythtv.sourceforge.net/mc/pip.jpg">Picture</a> in <a href="http://mythtv.sourceforge.net/mc/pip2.jpg">picture</a> support.  The secondary channel's also going through an encode/decode sequence, so it's possible to pause/rewind/fast-forward it, as well.  Just part of planned support for multiple tuner cards.
