    <li>Hey all, just wanted to make sure everyone saw that
        <a href="http://www.schedulesdirect.org">Schedules Direct</a> is now out
        of beta testing and fully open for anyone who wants to sign up.
        </li>
    <li>With the release of 0.20.2 the other day, switching your Myth config over
        from using Zap2It labs for data is fairly easy.  Please see
        <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/pipermail/mythtv-users/2007-August/191369.html">this
        mailing list posting from Bruce</a> for a short set of instructions - but
        it mainly just boils down to running mythtv-setup, changing the existing
        listings grabber to Schedules Direct, and putting in your new username +
        password (assuming you kept the same lineup config as on the old Labs
        website).  Took me well under 10 minutes.
        </li>
    <li>I know, it's a bit hard to start paying for guide data.  It was free for
        so long!  I'm not sure how many of you were around during the bad old
        days of having to screen scrape to get listings data, but it was
        decidedly not fun.  Constantly upgrading XMLTV to deal with website
        changes, etc.  So, really, I don't think paying a little bit for a
        stable source of good, complete data is unreasonable.  This was the
        best alternative we developers could come up with, given the lack of
        options available to us, but I realize that not everyone will agree.
        </li>
    <li>If you're on the fence about signing up due to feeling that the price
        is currently too high and you'd rather just wait, I'd like to ask you
        to please reconsider.  SD is a non-profit org run by open source/free
        software developers for the benefit of the users - not out to make
        money on this stuff - and the monthly/yearly price of membership will
        be lowered to meet costs.  But, how much the price goes down initially
        will really depend on how many users sign up during these first months.
        </li>
    <li>And finally, I'd like to thank everyone who has already become a member
        of SD - your support of this project is great. =)  And if you haven't,
        please <a href="http://www.schedulesdirect.org"> consider becoming a
        member of Schedules Direct</a>.  Thanks.
        </li>
