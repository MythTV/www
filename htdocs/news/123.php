Chris Petersen asked me to put up a update to his previous requests for help on
the MythWeb flash player and the mythtv.org website redesign.  See
<a href="http://svn.mythtv.org/trac/ticket/3394">this ticket in trac</a> for
more information on the current status of the SWF player, and join in the
discussion on the mythtv-dev mailing list to talk about website related stuff.
