  <li>I've just now gotten the basic recording selection GUI done and all the relevant database modification attached to it..  Check it out <a href="mc/epg-info.png">here</a>.  All that's left to do for recordings now is to write something that does the actual scheduling/conflict resolution (and debugging), and recordings will work.  And then an interface to playback recordings.  And then an interface to manage scheduled recordings.  And then, and then, and then.....
 <li>Picked up Warcraft III and Neverwinter Nights over the weekend.  On an unrelated note, no coding took place over the weekend. =)
