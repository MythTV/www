  <li>An update on the debian packages: They're now <a href="http://dijkstra.csh.rit.edu:8088/~mdz/debian/dists/woody/mythtv/">here</a>, and packages for mythmusic and mythweb are also available from the same location.
  <li>I did a little bit of work on some of the Qt-based UIs..  just made them use the menu theme for background graphics and text colors and the like.  I'll put up some screenshots in a day or two.
