  <li>Administrative stuff: I've set up a development mailing list, and a cvs commits mailing list for anyone who's interested.  See <a href="#mailing">here</a> for details.  I also went and changed the name of the project to MythTV.  Just a bit less unwieldy, compared to 'Mythical Convergence'.
  <li>Lotta changes under the hood, thanks to some contributed patches.  In short: live-tv mode should use considerably less cpu, and the a/v sync should work for everyone now.  I'd recommend grabbing a CVS tarball (go <a href="/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/">here</a> and click on the Download tarball link) if you're interested in checking things out, instead of the preview release.
