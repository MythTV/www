    <h1>MythVideo</h1>

    <p>
    A place to store, organise and play all those random video clips.
    Supports the MythTV internal player as well as several different
    external player utilities, so YouTube, Flash, archived DVDs, recorded
    TV or video camera clips should all be no problem.
    </p>
    <p>
    Also used to play DVD-Videos and VCDs from your frontend's CD/DVD
    drives, and when used with the MythTV internal player, allows
    bookmarks to be saved so you can continue watching from where you went
    to dinner, bed, the pub, etc.
