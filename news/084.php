  <li>At least, not if you're in North America and using the 0.9.1 release of MythTV.  For some strange reason, the XMLTV guys decided to change some things in an incompatible way on a micro version change.  Rather annoying, really.  I had fixed this in CVS MythTV a while back, but people are getting bit by this now.  Stick with XMLTV 0.5.10, wait for the 0.10 release of MythTV, or install current CVS.
