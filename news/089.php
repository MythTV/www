<ul>
  <li>Lot of changes recently, here's a run-down of the biggest:
  <li>Thor's been working on a DVD player/ripper module, which is available in CVS as the 'mythdvd' module.  It's useable now for watching DVDs (launching the player program of your choice), and making direct backups from discs -- transcoding support is coming soon.
  <li>Chris Petersen's mythweb rewrite is available in CVS as the 'mythweb2' module.  It's not quite yet a feature complete replacement for the old mythweb codebase, but it's getting there quickly.
  <li>I rewrote all of the mythgame user interface code so that it matches the rest of the UIs in MythTV now.  I updated the <a href="/detail/mythtv">Features and Screenshots</a> page to show off the new UI.  I also (finally) updated some of the TV OSD screenshots.
  <li>A bunch of other bugs have been fixed and the like, and things are looking pretty stable to me, so I'm thinking about releasing 0.11 sometime next week.
</ul>
