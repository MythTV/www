<ul>
    <li>New release!  It's been quite a while, so there's lots of new stuff.
        Notably: autodiscovery (less manual configuration of new frontends),
        storage groups (no need for LVM/etc), support for multiple recordings
        on one DVB/ATSC multiplex, a couple new plugins, some new
        deinterlacing/video display options, and many, many other things.
        </li>
    <li>The <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Release_Notes_-_0.21">Release
        notes page in the wiki</a> has the list of what's changed, but it's
        currently a couple thousand checkins out of date.
