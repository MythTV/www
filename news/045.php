<ul>
<li>Made a 10 line change to the existing customizeable color support in the program guide and came up with <a href="http://mythtv.sourceforge.net/mc/colorepg.jpg">this</a>.  Little slower to draw, but the end result's worth it, I'd think.  The other theme looks like <a href="http://mythtv.sourceforge.net/mc/colorepg2.jpg">this</a>.
<li>Made the OSD fade away instead of just disappearing.  I like easy code with neat eyecandy results. =)
<li>Threw a <a href="http://mythtv.sourceforge.net/mc/gallery.jpg">basic image gallery</a> together.  'Bout an hour's worth of coding, though all it does so far is display all image files in a single directory as thumbnails, and let you choose images to view fullscreen.  It's intended to be just a very simple gallery program, with support for slideshows and directory browsing..
