<ul>
    <li>In light of our recent switch to using git, we will be renaming the svn.mythtv.org
        domain name to code.mythtv.org.</li>
    <li>Both domains should work at the moment, but we will eventually start redirecting
        requests to the old svn.mythtv.org domain name.</li>
    <li>We will also have a few new code-related services running on this host, including
        experimental copies of Jira and Fisheye.</li>
</ul>
