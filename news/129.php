    <li>Just a quick update to let you all know that development work on
        <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Release_Notes_-_0.22">0.22</a>
        is still progressing smoothly.  We appreciate your patience while
        we are working through some of the more tedious parts of this upcoming
        release.</li>
    <li>In other news, <a href="http://schedulesdirect.org/">Schedules Direct</a>
        is still looking for input from users from outside of the US and
        Canada.  We know that there are a lot of MythTV users abroad, and it
        would really help them out if you would head over there and
        <a href="http://xris.schedulesdirect.org/survey/where">fill out the survey</a>
        that they've posted.
        </li>
    <li>Schedules Direct is also looking for
        <a href="http://forums.schedulesdirect.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=710">volunteer developers</a>
        to help design and implement a new application to deliver guide data
        themselves (rather than rely on TMS servers), which they expect to
        serve to 20,000 or more members daily over the next few years.  They
        have been a big help to the MythTV community, and could really use some
        help.  If you have experience with Perl, PHP, and/or MySQL, please take
        a look at their
        <a href="http://forums.schedulesdirect.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=710">forum post</a>
        for information about applying to help.
