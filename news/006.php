  <li>Got a new TV Tuner card -- a <a href="http://www.hauppauge.com/html/products.htm#pci">Hauppauge WinTV-Radio</a> card.  Supports stereo audio and comes with a remote control, unlike the cheaper card I was using before.  Modified things to work with the remote a little better, and added some example lirc config files to CVS.                                                                      </ul>
