  <li>Thanks to Michael and Heidi Greb, there's a <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/index.php/Themes">new themes section</a> now online.  Mainly, it allows for more screenshots to be shown for each theme, not just the main menu one from the old themes gallery.
  <li>I've updated PurpleGalaxy and Visor to their 0.13 compatible versions, and have added the new-for-0.13 themes Gant and Sleek to the list.
  <li>Still need to figure out how to handle OSD themes with the new section, but that should hopefully get taken care of soon.
