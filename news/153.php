<p>
Although we may not be known for using a witty naming scheme, and the version
number only increments itself by a single "hundredth" every major release,
we're extremely proud to announce the immediate release of what we loving refer
to as - "0.25"!  It's been 516 days (that's 1 year, 4 months, 30 days) since
our last major release, so it goes without saying that a significant amount of
work has made its way in to this current release with over 5200 commits making
up 0.25.
</p>

<p>
MythTV version 0.25 includes several significant new features.  A few key items
to point out - new video acceleration capabilities such as VAAPI and DirectX
Video Acceleration 2; expanded and improved audio capabilities including E-AC3,
TrueHD, and DTS-HD support; Control your TV and other AV components via CEC
(Consumer Electronics Control); enhanced and integrated metadata management
capabilities for recordings and videos, and a fully functional API for
third-party apps to build upon that can interact with both the frontend and
backend - including a HTTP Live Streaming capabilities for delivering video
content, in real-time, via the API.  
</p>

<p>
Also noteworthy - MythMusic has been completely re-written and MythVideo is now
directly integrated rather than being distributed as a separate plugin. 
Additionally, MythThemes is no longer maintained as a separate repository – all
themes, including third party themes, can now be downloaded directly from the
frontend theme chooser.
