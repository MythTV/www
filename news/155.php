<p>
We are happy to announce that 0.26-beta is now ready, although delayed due to
some deadlock bugs that took longer to debug than expected.
</p>

<p>
The release schedule will be updated sometime soon once the beta has had some
soaking-in testing time, although the string freeze is still set for August 12.
