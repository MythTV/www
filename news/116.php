  <li>Good morning.  After many months, we have a new release of MythTV for you.  Because, you know, we like you.  Kind of.  Anyway.
  <li>The <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Release_Notes_-_0.19">Release notes page in the wiki</a> has a great list of what's new and changed.
  <li>In case you didn't notice the link in the last sentence, there's also now an <a href="http://wiki.mythtv.org">official wiki</a>, too.  It's mostly the data from the old un-official wiki at mythtv.info, cleaned up a bit.  I'd been waiting for the release to be ready to announce it, so, erm, consider it announced.
  <li>Standard release info:
  <ul>
    <li>Grab the release from the  <a href="/download">download section</a> and please at least try to read the <a href="/docs">docs</a> before asking questions. 
    <li>The <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Packages">binary packages</a> should hopefully be updated to 0.19 soon.
    <li>See this <a href="/download#other-downloads">links section</a> for a list of complete linux distributions based around MythTV.
  </ul>
