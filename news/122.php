Hey, long time no update.  Been a little on the busy side of things lately, but
development's still happening/etc, things are coming along nicely.  Anyway.
Chris asked me to post this:
<ul>
    <li>We are currently looking for artists to work on a redesign of
        mythtv.org.  You don't need to know anything about HTML/CSS, just have
        a good eye for UI design.
        </li>

    <li>I am also looking for a Flash developer who would be interested in
        working with me on flash-based video and music players for MythWeb. I'm
        having a lot of trouble locating a good one that is also compatible with
        the GPL (most are under the Apache license, which is not), and would
        also like to eventually enhance the video player for LiveTV viewing,
        which will require more than just playback features.  More info can be
        found
        <a href="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/mythtv/dev/253469">here</a>.
        </li>
    <li>Interested parties should contact me directly via the feedback page at
        <a href="http://forevermore.net/feedback.php">http://forevermore.net/feedback.php</a>.
        </li>
</ul>
