  <li>Long time no updates.  Lotta stuff been going on, though.  The split to allow multiple playback boxes and multiple encoder boxes is getting close to being complete, and there's a lot of nice new graphical config stuff thanks to Matt Zimmerman.  Maybe 0.8'll be ready sometime in mid-early January.
