<ul>
  <li>Chris Pinkham's contributed the beginnings of automatic commerical skipping, which is now in CVS.  Seems to work fairly well, though it's still under development.
  <li>I never mentioned, but a contribution by Todd Malsbary added NES emulator support to mythgame a while back, and he just updated it to support zipped rom files.
  <li>A bunch more visualizations got added to mythmusic, courtesy of Thor (ie, the mythweb guy) and myself.  Little more variety for those tired of Synaesthesia.
  <li>Also a while back, Lonnie Hutchinson contributed a patch to mythmusic to encode files while it rips from CD.  Speeds things up a little, and is easier overall on the CPU.
  <li>As for the next release, I have one item left on my TODO list for it -- support for multiple encoder machines.  Still don't know when I'll put together a release, though.
