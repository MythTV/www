  <li>I committed the first chunk of the multiple playback/encoder box support last night.  Lots of stuff is broken.
  <li>Added a link to a <a href="http://www.gossamer-threads.com/archive/Misc_C2/MythTV_F10/">searchable archive</a> of the <a href="/support">mailing list</a>.  Now, no more excuses about not wanting to look through the archives for something already posted to the list. =)
  <li>Got a new theme submission the other day, get it <a href="http://www.ziarek.com/mythtv">here</a>.  To install/use it, you'll need to make a 'colorbars' directory in your /usr/local/share/mythtv/themes/ directory, decompress the theme file into there, and change the Theme setting in the theme.txt file to 'colorbars'.  Slick.
