<p>
As part of the attempt to have a shorter release cycle, we have now released
v0.26-alpha.
</p>

<p>
The proposed schedule for the v0.26 release cycle is as follows:<br />
<ul>
<li>July 15th - v0.26-alpha</li>
<li> - Feature freeze, bug fixes OK, soft freeze on translatable strings.</li>
<li>July 29th - v0.26-beta</li>
<li> - Only critical bug fixes allowed after this date.</li>
<li>August 12th - v0.26-rc0</li>
<li> - hard freeze on translatable strings.</li>
<li>August 19th - either v0.26 (final) or v0.26-rc1</li>
<li> - If any further critical bug fixes required, we cut another RC and wait a week, repeat until no bug fixes for a week.</li>
<li> - When no bug fixes required for one week, we will cut the final release</li>
</p>
