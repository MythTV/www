    <li>After many years running under PHP-Nuke, MythTV.org is now proudly
        running its own customized website application, which we hope will be
        faster and more secure than the old site.  Plus, we think it looks a
        <strong>whole lot</strong> better than the old site.
        </li>
    <li>The new website has a lot of new features including an RSS/Atom feed,
        the digg links to the right, and an all new &quot;MythTV in Detail&quot;
        section, so please feel free to poke around and explore the new layout.
        It's also a lot easier for us to maintain, update, and improve, so we
        hope to be able to provide more frequent updates than before, too.
        </li>
    <li>If you get a chance, drop by #mythtv-users on irc.freenode.net and
        thank designer <a href="http://miffteevee.co.uk/">Stuart Morgan</a>
        (gbee) and coder <a href="http://forevermore.net/">Chris Petersen</a>
        (xris) for all of the great work they put into setting up the new site.

    <li>On a side note, <a href="http://schedulesdirect.org/">Schedules Direct</a>
        is looking for information about users from outside of the US and Canada.
        We know that there are a lot of MythTV users abroad, and it would really
        help them out if you would head over there and fill out the
        <a href="http://xris.schedulesdirect.org/survey/where">survey</a> that
        they've posted.
