    <p>Four months ago today we launched our official MythTV forums in response to a great demand from our users. To some of you this will be old news, but if you haven't already visited the forum then why not sign up today? It's a great place to share your experiences of MythTV, to find answers to your questions or to help out other members of the community by answering their questions.</p>

    <p>Some of you have expressed concern that we will be closing down the mailing lists. I can assure you that this is not the case, the forums are not here to replace the mailing lists but to provide everyone with a choice. Some people prefer forums, other people prefer mailing lists; there are advantages and disadvantages to both.</p>

    <p>The forums can be found by clicking on the link at the top right of the page. You can also use this link if that sounds like too much work: <a href="https://forum.mythtv.org/">Official Forums</a></p>
