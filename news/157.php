<p>We are happy to announce that we have now released v0.27-alpha.</p>

<p>The proposed schedule for the v0.27 release cycle is as follows:
<br />
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td width="40%">July 21st - 0.27-alpha</td>
<td>Bug fixes only, soft freeze for translatable strings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>August 4th  - 0.27-beta</td>
<td>Only critical bug fixes allowed after this date.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>August 11th - 0.27-rc1</td>
<td> First  Release Candidate, hard freeze for translatable strings.
        If critical bug fix required, we will cut new rc and wait
        another week.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TBD -  rc2-x</td>
<td>As needed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TBD - Release</td>
<td>RC becomes release when no bug fix required for one week.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>As always these dates are subject to change if the resolution of some 
critical/blocker bugs needed it.</p>
